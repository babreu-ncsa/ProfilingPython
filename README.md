# Profiling Python Applications

This repository contains examples on how to profile Python applications using `cProfile` and `snakeviz` modules.

## Creating the environment
To reproduce the same environment, I suggest using Anaconda. If you have it installed, you can use [environment.yml](./environment.yml) to create it using
```bash
conda create --name <EnvName> --file environment.yml
```
and activate it with
```bash
conda activate <EnvName>
```
